// Create a web page with an embedded JavaScript program that plays the “number guessing game” with the user as follows:

// The user is asked to think of an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
// The program needs to repeatedly take guesses at the number the user has in mind.
// To each of the program’s guesses, the user responds “<” if the target number is less than the program’s guess; “>” if the target number is greater than the program’s guess; or “yes” if the program has guessed the number correctly.
// You need to come up with and implement the most efficient strategy for your program.

// let num = 50;
// let ans = prompt("Is this your number?" + num);

while != "Yes" 
console.log(ans)
